GCM,
I converted some html files into php. If opened with my Chrome browser, it only displays the code.
Now it seems that you need to install XAMPP too.
XAMPP's for the database so you can also access the system via localhost since I already made a database for registered users.
Once you install the XAMPP, go to C:\xampp\htdocs, then clone the repository of our project there.
Then type localhost/cedula at the browser to access our system.
Then to access your local database, go to localhost/phpmyadmin.
I can teach you some further steps. If you need, just dictate the time.
